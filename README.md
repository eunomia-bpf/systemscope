# systemscope - eBPF Wall Clock Profiler

A high-performance wall-clock profiler that combines on-CPU and off-CPU profiling to provide complete visibility into application performance. Built using eBPF technology for zero-instrumentation profiling with minimal overhead.

## Features

- **Combined Wall-Clock Profiling**: Simultaneously tracks both on-CPU execution time and off-CPU blocking time
- **Multi-threaded Support**: Automatically detects and profiles multi-threaded applications with per-thread analysis
- **Visual Flamegraphs**: Generates interactive SVG flamegraphs with color-coded on-CPU (red) and off-CPU (blue) frames
- **Low Overhead**: Less than 1% CPU overhead using eBPF-based profiling
- **Zero Instrumentation**: No modifications needed to target applications

## Examples

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Linux kernel 4.9+ with eBPF support
- Python 3.6+
- Root privileges (for eBPF)

### Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies and build tools
make install

# Or manually install dependencies
sudo apt-get install -y libelf1 libelf-dev zlib1g-dev make clang llvm python3 git perl
```

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Profile a process for 30 seconds
make run PID=1234

# Custom profiling parameters
make run PID=1234 DURATION=60 FREQ=99 MIN_BLOCK=5000

# Or run directly with Python
sudo python3 cpu-tools/wallclock_profiler.py 1234 -d 30 -f 49 -m 1000
```

## Command-Line Options

```
Usage: python3 cpu-tools/wallclock_profiler.py <PID> [OPTIONS]

Arguments:
  PID                   Process ID to profile

Options:
  -d, --duration        Profiling duration in seconds (default: 30)
  -f, --frequency       On-CPU sampling frequency in Hz (default: 49)
  -m, --min-block-us    Minimum off-CPU block time in microseconds (default: 1000)
  -o, --output          Output file prefix (default: combined_profile_pid<PID>_<timestamp>)
```

## Output Files

The profiler generates several output files:

### Single-threaded Applications
- `combined_profile_pid<PID>_<timestamp>.svg` - Interactive flamegraph
- `combined_profile_pid<PID>_<timestamp>.folded` - Folded stack format data
- `combined_profile_pid<PID>_<timestamp>_single_thread_analysis.txt` - Time analysis report

### Multi-threaded Applications
- `multithread_combined_profile_pid<PID>_<timestamp>/` - Directory containing:
  - `thread_<TID>_<role>.svg` - Per-thread flamegraph
  - `thread_<TID>_<role>.folded` - Per-thread folded data
  - `thread_<TID>_<role>_analysis.txt` - Per-thread analysis
  - `<base>_thread_analysis.txt` - Overall thread analysis summary

## Understanding the Flamegraphs

- **Red frames (_[c])**: On-CPU execution time - shows where CPU cycles are spent
- **Blue frames (_[o])**: Off-CPU blocking time - shows I/O wait, sleep, locks, etc.
- **Width**: Represents relative time spent in each function
- **Height**: Shows call stack depth
- **Interactive**: Click on frames to zoom, search for functions

## Examples

### Profile a Python Application

```bash
# Start your Python application
python my_app.py &
PID=$!

# Profile it
make run PID=$PID DURATION=30

# View the flamegraph
firefox combined_profile_pid${PID}_*.svg
```

### Analyze Database Performance

```bash
# Find MySQL process
PID=$(pgrep mysqld)

# Profile with longer duration for better coverage
make run PID=$PID DURATION=60 MIN_BLOCK=5000

# Check results
ls combined_profile_pid${PID}_*/
```

### Debug High CPU Usage

```bash
# Quick profiling with higher frequency
sudo python3 cpu-tools/wallclock_profiler.py $PID -d 10 -f 99
```

### Profile Multi-threaded Application

```bash
# The profiler automatically detects multi-threaded apps
make run PID=$PID

# Results will be in multithread_combined_profile_*/
# Each thread gets its own flamegraph and analysis
```

## Architecture

The wall clock profiler combines two eBPF-based tools:

1. **oncputime**: Samples on-CPU execution using perf events
   - Captures stack traces at specified frequency
   - Tracks actual CPU consumption

2. **offcputime**: Tracks off-CPU blocking events
   - Records when threads block and for how long
   - Captures blocking reasons (I/O, locks, sleep)

3. **wallclock_profiler.py**: Orchestrates profiling
   - Runs both tools simultaneously
   - Normalizes and combines results
   - Generates unified flamegraphs
   - Handles multi-threaded applications

## Performance Considerations

- **Sampling Frequency**: Default 49 Hz balances overhead vs accuracy
  - Increase for short-lived events (up to 999 Hz)
  - Decrease for long-running production profiling

- **Min Block Time**: Default 1000 Î¼s (1ms) filters short blocks
  - Increase to reduce data volume
  - Decrease to catch micro-contentions

- **Overhead**: Typically < 1% CPU at default settings
  - Scales with sampling frequency and stack depth

## Troubleshooting

### Permission Denied
```bash
# Requires root or CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability
sudo python3 cpu-tools/wallclock_profiler.py <PID>
```

### No Stack Traces
```bash
# Enable frame pointers for better stack traces
echo 1 | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_paranoid

# For compiled languages, rebuild with -fno-omit-frame-pointer
```

### Process Not Found
```bash
# Verify the process exists
ps -p <PID>
```

### Low Coverage Warning
This indicates the process was mostly idle during profiling. Try:
- Increasing duration
- Profiling during active workload
- Checking if the process is actually running

## Building from Source

The profiling tools (oncputime and offcputime) need to be built:

```bash
# Build the eBPF tools
cd cpu-tools
make

# Or use the main Makefile
make install
```

## Time Analysis

The profiler provides detailed time accounting:

- **On-CPU Time**: Actual CPU execution time (samples / frequency)
- **Off-CPU Time**: Blocking time from offcputime tool
- **Total Time**: Sum of on-CPU and off-CPU
- **Wall Clock Coverage**: Percentage of profiling duration covered

Coverage interpretation:
- < 50%: Process mostly idle or sleeping
- 50-100%: Normal active process
- > 100%: Multi-threaded or measurement overlap
